## Short description

Text Files represent a large number of information we deal with today, the most basic forms of text storage systems in existence. Everything from ReadMe files for the biggest of the software to acting as text editors. Text files play a vital role. The use of text files are often disoriented and are not preferred to be a choice of use in the long term. Users have them converted to various forms such as CSV (For Data Sets), PDF (Official Documentation).



### Problem Description

Converting non readable text files to structured CSV files using C++ and itâ€™s concepts. This format conversion algorithm is proposed to make use of powerful unix and C++ commands to carefully manipulate the .txt files and have them converted into CSV Representation. Data input is expected to be a disorganized text file with more than 300 lines of data along with field seperators, to which output is an expected CSV file in a notepad/Excel.
